## Description

<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;">

**Alpha Version Warning**: This project is currently in its alpha version. It has been tested exclusively on Virtualmin VPS. While it might function on other servers like Plesk, cPanel, etc., it's strongly recommended to create a backup of your files before executing it.

In forthcoming versions, I plan to overhaul the entire philosophy of the plugin. Rather than simply replacing content, the new approach will involve renaming the old file to `_old` and situating the modified new file in its designated place. Rigorous testing will also be conducted on different servers (primarily to address issues with absolute paths). Moreover, a backend management panel is on the roadmap.

Until these advancements are realized, cheers and best of luck! ðŸ˜‰

WP Hijack is a WordPress plugin developed by Nicolas Lagios that allows you to preserve your theme and plugin customizations even after updates. Instead of losing your changes, this plugin hijacks specific files and replaces their content with custom versions from within the plugin, ensuring your modifications remain intact.

**Please Note:** Modifying theme and plugin files directly is generally not recommended practice. It's preferable to use hooks, filters, and actions to extend or modify functionality to avoid issues during updates. WP Hijack is intended for use in specific scenarios where no filter or action is available for making your customizations.

## Features

- Simple and straightforward plugin setup.
- Safeguard your theme and plugin modifications.
- Easy-to-use management panel (coming soon in the next version).

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nicolaslagios/wp-hijack).
2. Upload the plugin folder to your WordPress installation's `wp-content/plugins` directory.
3. Activate the "WP Hijack" plugin from the WordPress admin dashboard.

## Usage

To use WP Hijack, follow these steps:

1. Open the plugin file (`bypasser.php`) and find the `$theme_replaced_files_array` and `$plugins_replaced_files_array`.
2. Add the file paths and their corresponding identifiers (e.g., function names) to the arrays for themes and plugins you want to preserve.
3. Create custom versions of those files and store them in the `custom-theme-files` and `custom-plugin-files` subfolders within the plugin.
4. After a theme or plugin update, WP Hijack will automatically replace the original files with your custom versions if the specified identifiers are found.

**Note:** The next version of the plugin will include a management panel for easier handling of file modifications.
